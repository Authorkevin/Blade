        # The view's perform_create calls serializer.save(user=request.user)
        # The serializer's create method is what we are effectively testing via this endpoint.
        # If using ModelSerializer, it will call UserVideoInteraction.objects.create()
        # So, we mock that.

        # To make UserVideoInteractionSerializer(mock_created_interaction_instance).data work,
        # the mock needs to have fields the serializer expects.
        # It's often easier to let the actual serializer work if possible and mock only deep DB calls.
        # However, with DB issues, full mocking is safer.

        # For now, this test focuses on endpoint reachability and basic path.
        # A full integration test would require a working DB or more elaborate serializer mocking.

        # This test will likely fail if the DB is truly inaccessible as the serializer
        # might try to validate the 'video' field by fetching the Video instance.
        # We can only proceed conceptually here.

        # response = api_client_fixture.post(url, interaction_data, format='json')
        # assert response.status_code == status.HTTP_201_CREATED
        # assert response.data['liked'] is True
        # mock_interaction_create.assert_called_once()
        pass # Conceptual test due to DB dependency for Video instance validation by serializer

    # Add more tests: list interactions, retrieve specific, update, delete
    # Each will need careful mocking due to DB state.
```
This provides a more robust structure for API tests with better mocking. However, the note about DB dependency remains; these tests are more about structure and intent under the current constraints.
